. Fundamental Concepts of Version Control
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time, allowing multiple people to collaborate efficiently. It helps track modifications, revert to previous versions, and maintain project integrity. Git is a widely used version control system, and GitHub is a cloud-based platform that facilitates Git-based version control.
2. Why GitHub is Popular
GitHub provides:
• Collaboration Tools: Supports multiple contributors with features like pull requests and issue tracking.
• Cloud Storage: Centralized storage for repositories.
• CI/CD Integration: Supports automated testing and deployment.
• Security & Permissions: Controls access with public/private repositories and branch protection rules.
3. Setting Up a New Repository on GitHub
Key Steps:
1. Log into GitHub and navigate to the "Repositories" tab.
2. Click "New Repository."
3. Provide a repository name and optional description.
4. Choose visibility: Public or Private.
5. Initialize with a README, .gitignore, and license (optional).
6. Click "Create Repository."
4. Importance of README File
A README is the first document users see and should include:
- Project title and description.
- Installation and usage instructions.
- Contribution guidelines.
- License information.
- Contact details.

It ensures clarity, facilitates onboarding, and enhances collaboration.
5. Public vs. Private Repositories
Public repositories are open for anyone to view and contribute, while private repositories restrict access to authorized users.
• Public: Best for open-source projects and knowledge sharing.
• Private: Best for proprietary and confidential projects.
6. Making Your First Commit
Steps:
1. Clone the repository or initialize a new one.
2. Create or modify a file.
3. Stage the file using `git add`.
4. Commit changes using `git commit -m "Initial commit"`.
5. Push to GitHub using `git push origin main`.
7. Git Branching
Branches allow multiple developers to work on features independently.
8. Role of Pull Requests
Pull requests enable code review before merging into the main branch.
9. Forking vs. Cloning
• Forking creates a copy of a repository under a different account for independent contributions.
• Cloning creates a local copy of a repository for personal development.
10. Issues and Project Boards
Issues track bugs and feature requests, while project boards help manage tasks.
11. Challenges & Best Practices
• Use descriptive commit messages.
• Regularly pull changes using `git pull`.
• Review code via PRs before merging.
• Maintain a structured branching strategy.
